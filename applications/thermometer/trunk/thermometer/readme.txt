THERMOMETER
-----------

Example program that creates a simple thermometer using the TC4 or TC4C.

This illustrates the most basic use of a TC4 device.

In addition to the Arduino IDE, these folders/files must
be put in the "libararies" folder of your Arduino sketchbook:

cADC
 - cADC.h
 - cADC.cpp

thermocouple
 - thermocouple.h
 - thermocouple.cpp
